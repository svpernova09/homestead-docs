## Updating Homestead

Before you begin updating Homestead you should ensure you have removed your current virtual machine by running the following command in your Homestead directory:

```bash
vagrant destroy
```

Next, you need to update the Homestead source code. If you cloned the repository, you can execute the following commands at the location you originally cloned the repository:

```bash
git fetch
git pull origin release
```

These commands pull the latest Homestead code from the GitHub repository, fetch the latest tags, and then check out the latest tagged release. You can find the latest stable release version on Homestead's [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/laravel/homestead/releases).

If you have installed Homestead via your project's `composer.json` file, you should ensure your `composer.json` file contains `"laravel/homestead": "^12"` and update your dependencies:

```bash
composer update
```

Next, you should update the Vagrant box using the `vagrant box update` command:

```bash
vagrant box update
```

After updating the Vagrant box, you should run the `bash init.sh` command from the Homestead directory in order to update Homestead's additional configuration files. You will be asked whether you wish to overwrite your existing `Homestead.yaml`, `after.sh`, and `aliases` files:

```bash
    // Mac / Linux...
    bash init.sh

    // Windows...
    init.bat
```

Finally, you will need to regenerate your Homestead virtual machine to utilize the latest Vagrant installation:

```bash
vagrant up
```
